// IMP Exmaples
// ============

// In this file several tests are provided for KAT.

// Looping
// -------

// This is the classic `sum` program, which just sums the numbers from 1 to 10.

// This version of the `sum` proogram has additional statements after the main
// while loop.

// Here the Collatz loop is provided, which calculates how many steps it takes a
// given number to go to 1 using Collatz update.
