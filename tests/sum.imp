// IMP Exmaples
// ============

// In this file several tests are provided for KAT. The file `tests/runtests.sh`
// should be run with K commit `e14da0a` from Github.

// Looping
// -------

// This is the classic `sum` program, which just sums the numbers from 1 to 10.


int n , s ;

n = 10 ;
while (0 <= n) {
  n = n + -1 ;
  s = s + n ;
}


// This version of the `sum` proogram has additional statements after the main
// while loop.

// Here the Collatz loop is provided, which calculates how many steps it takes a
// given number to go to 1 using Collatz update.
