// Running KAT
// ===========

// We'll use a simple testing harness in `bash` which just checks the output of
// `krun --search` against a supplied file. Run this with `bash runtests.sh`.

// BIMC
// ----

// Here, we allow each program to initialize (get through variable declarations) by
// running `step-with skip`. Then we issue some `bimc` query to check if the
// program obeys the given invariant up to the depth-bound.

// ### Sum

// Query with large bound to find which step pushed the sum above `32`:
