// IMP-KAT Tests
// =============

// This is a simple testing harness driven by the `tangle` script. Call
// `./tangle test` in the root directory to run the test-set.

// BIMC
// ----

// Here, we allow each program to initialize (get through variable declarations) by
// running `step-with skip`. Then we issue some `bimc` query to check if the
// program obeys the given invariant up to the depth-bound.

// ### Infinite Division

// Here we test that BIMC is able to catch division by zero errors.
