// Examples
// ========

// Compile the file `imp-strategies.k` with the command
// `kompile --main-module IMP-ANALYSIS imp-strategies.k`.

// Bounded Invariant Model Checking {#bounded-invariant-model-checking-1}
// --------------------------------

// Here we check the property `x <= 7` for 5 steps of execution after the code has
// initialized (the `step` in front of the command). Run this with
// `krun --search test-bmc.imp`.


strategy : bmc-invariant 5 (bexp? x <= 7) ; skip

=====

int x ;
x = 0 ;
x = x + 15 ;


// Note that to develop the `bmc-invariant` strategy, I experimented by changing
// the above over and over again. Each time I had to re-`krun`, which is relatively
// slow, but there is no reason to re-start the symbolic execution engine.
